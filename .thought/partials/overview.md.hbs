## Maintainers / Contributors wanted

*I'm sorry to say that I won't be able to develop new features for this project in the near future. 
But: I will probably be able to discuss and merge pull-requests, and to publish new versions.*

Please understand that I'm not using `bootprint-openapi` myself at the moment and all I'm doing (or not doing 
at the moment) is for other people to fill their needs. I have a limited time each week to work on open-source
projects and I want to work on some other projects.

#### Here is my proposal

* If you want to start maintaining the module(s), please let me know and I'll give you push access.
* I will help you by giving pointers to code-lines that need to be changed for a given feature.
* I will try to publish new versions as fast as possible.
* I might also give you publishing-rights on npm, although that seems like a large step and I would have to 
  be confident that you don't misuse it. Asking doesn't cost.

## Overview

This package contains a template, partials and styles for [bootprint](http://npmjs.com/bootprint) to convert
OpenAPI-Specifications into a static HTML-page.

This package was formerly known as `bootprint-swagger` and has been renamed, because 
Swagger-Specification has been renamed to OpenAPI-Specification
